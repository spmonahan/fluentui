# RFC: SSR Context

## Summary

We write an extensive amount of documentation and specifications for Fluent UI v9 but it is not organized in a consistent, discoverable way. This lack of organization makes it difficult for developers familiar with the repo to find relevant information and challenging for newcomers to know where to start.

## Glossary

- "the wiki": The Fluent UI Wiki hosted on Github
- "storybook": The Fluent UI public docs site (e.g., the < v9 site)
- "public docs": the same as "storybook"
- "users": people using Fluent UI to build apps who are not contributing code to Fluent UI (e.g., they use Button in their app)
- "contributors": people contributing code to Fluent UI (e.g., they build the Button component). For the purposes of this doc this includes the core team.
- "readme": documentation file that lives with the source code it documents

## Problem statement

There is no clear guidance on what information belongs in the Fluent UI Github wiki vs what documentation belongs in the Fluent docs site vs what belongs in a readme. Many aspects of Fluent are well-documented in writing but it is not clear where to find information. Additionally, the structure of the wiki mixes different versions of the library at different levels of the documentation making it difficult to explore the wiki with a consistent narrative. As a result it's often easier for both users and contributors to simply ask a question in a Teams support channel to find the information they need. This takes time away from the core team that is better spent responding to concerns that are not covered in documentation.
